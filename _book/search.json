providence to bring us together.\n\nThe old times,\nThey don't measure up to the new.\nBut the new times,\nThey don't feel like the old.\nIt's just how we grow.\n\nLike that time,\nwe went

trees.\n\nLove is the ache you feel when she doesn’t pick up the phone,\nThe emptiness you feel waking up,\nThe pain from the distance and different time zones.\n\nLove isn’t being comfortable at all times,\nHaving the answers to all of your problems,\nGiving reasons to stay together forever.\n\nLove is sharing our scars,\nCounting the days till we see each other,\nWaking up late and starting the day beyond normal.\n\nLove isn’t rational like math and science,\nIt is responsible for being irresponsible, \nIt is the feeling of fullness and belonging.\n\nEven when my hair is bushy and my clothes are baggy,\nWhen my English isn't English,\nWhen my body isn't as distinguished,\n\nYou accept me for me,\nAnd I accept you for you."},{"path":"family.html","id":"family","chapter":"4

Saturdays,\nand church on Sundays,\nTo hear the preacher preach.\n\nWe sang, ate, and played.\nThey made me think about my life,\nThe good, the bad,\nand everything in between.\n\nThose days cannot be\nthese days.\nBut I can make these days\nbetter days.\n\nWith someone,\nSomeone,\nspecifically,\nYOU!"},{"path":"sleepless-nights-house-alone.html","id":"sleepless-nights-house-alone","chapter":"5

fear.\n\nI sleep lightly,\nScared of something,\nStirred to uncertainty.\n\nNo laws against silence,\nEvery sound a nail,\nto the boards of emptiness.\n\nA frenzied attack.\nI merely lie still,\nWith no means of defense.\n\nHow my skin crawls, itches, and senses,\nThe assault begins,\nAs I start my sleep.\n\nWhy do I let my mind,\nPremature in sleep.\nGet under my skin.\n\nHow I wish to take shelter in you.\nto hold you, to kiss you,\nand stay by you forever."},{"path":"journey.html","id":"journey","chapter":"6 Journey","heading":"6 Journey","text":"April 25, 2020September 11,

falling,\nSinking lower at each stride,\nRising high with each low.\n\nThousands of fools,\nObsessed in their self-destruction,\nBut that’s how the journey is,\nThe journey of love.\n\nTo bear the distant longing,\nTo bear sleepiness from endless talking,\nTo bear two different worlds,\nHoping on converging.\n\nHow I hold space in my life,\nFor a vision of you,\nWho will come by,\nTo lift me higher.\n\nTo feel a bond,\nThat feeling is \nWhat I starve for\nBeyond all."},{"path":"a-soft-cough.html","id":"a-soft-cough","chapter":"7 A Soft Cough","heading":"7 A Soft Cough","text":"October 27,
