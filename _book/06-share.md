# A Soft Cough 


```r
A soft cough,
That is good,
for clearing a throat.

The virtues of voice,
Can build our dreams
Or corrupt our souls.  

We share out moments,
gathering experiences,
to link and find ourselves. 

It can seem exhausting,
But a soft cough,
Can bring back your breath.

But for me,
a soft cough,
can't bring back my breath.

For my breath lies in you,
my future wife, 
you are my life.
You are my breath.
