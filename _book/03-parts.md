# Family 


```r
When I was a kid,
I went to temple on Saturdays,
and church on Sundays,
To hear the preacher preach.

We sang, ate, and played.
They made me think about my life,
The good, the bad,
and everything in between.

Those days cannot be
these days.
But I can make these days
better days.

With someone,
Someone,
specifically,
YOU!
