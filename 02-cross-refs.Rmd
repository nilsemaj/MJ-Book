# Whatlove is or isn’t

```{r eval=FALSE}

Love isn’t a beautiful spring in an enchanted forest,
Deep in the soft misty dew,
Songs from the birds and quaking trees.

Love is the ache you feel when she doesn’t pick up the phone,
The emptiness you feel waking up,
The pain from the distance and different time zones.

Love isn’t being comfortable at all times,
Having the answers to all of your problems,
Giving reasons to stay together forever.

Love is sharing our scars,
Counting the days till we see each other,
Waking up late and starting the day beyond normal.

Love isn’t rational like math and science,
It is responsible for being irresponsible, 
It is the feeling of fullness and belonging.

Even when my hair is bushy and my clothes are baggy,
When my English isn't English,
When my body isn't as distinguished,

You accept me for me,
And I accept you for you.
