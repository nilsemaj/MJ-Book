# How do I be there?


```r
I would like to be there,
There where ever you are.
Pray the weight of the distance is less,
Than the weight of luck.
The luck of providence to bring us together.

The old time
They don't measure up to the new
But the new times
They don't feel like the old
It's just how we grow

Like that time 
we went kayaking,
and within a year 
we came together 
and began paddling
