# Family 

```{r eval=FALSE}
When I was a kid,
I went to temple on Saturday 
and church on Sunday,
To hear the preacher preach

They made me think about everything good,
everything bad,
and everything in between
In my life

We sang songs,
enjoyed good foods,
celebrated our freedoms

But now its time
To experience these things
with someone new

Someone,
specifically 

YOU
